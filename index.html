                    <h2> A Day In My Life : MCO EDITION!</h2>
                    
            
            <P>My alarm goes off at 6:00. I’ve been awake since 4 am actually. My sleep pattern becomes weird since <b>Movement Control Order (MCO) </b> start.</P>
            
                    <P>I just swiped right the alarm to turn it off and perform my subuh prayer</P>
            <P>It's 6.20 am or so and today is the first online class for UiTM. So, I’m preparing for todays’ lesson by checking the timetable for today, installing apps needed for every lecture and preparing recall back the last lesson before MCO start by went through the slide given by lecturers a few time.</P>
            <P>Most of the classes uses <a href="https://classroom.google.com/h" target=_blank> Google Classroom </a> as a medium so install the apps and make sure I already join the classes as instructed by my lecturers.</P>
            <P>I have 8 am class and my lecturer for that class had assigned a task that needed to be submit by 12 pm. I did the task as instructed and submitted it to him before 10am.</P>
             <p>As I’ve done with morning class I felt hungry. Since I haven’t showered yet, <i>*perks of online distance learning*</i>. I took a shower first and then head to the kitchen and search for something to cook for breakfast. </p>       
                    
            <P>I found some instant noodle and decided to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwPXrkuTSYo" target=_blank> Mee Goreng Basah </a> as I watched the YouTube tutorial video the other night.</P>
            
            <P>So I made breakfast, sat at the dining table and had my breakfast while watching a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/my/title/81177545" target=_blank> Netflix drama </a> I'm currently watching.</P>
            <center> <img src="mi.jpg" alt="Mee Goreng Basah" width="240" height="320"> </center>
                    

                    <P> It’s almost 12 when I finished eating so I did my dishes and did some homework.</P>                    
                    <P>For 2pm class we’re going to discuss tutorial questions so I’m preparing my answer and double check it. Since all assignment needed to be submitted through e-mail, I need to retype my answer from my notebook.
                    </P>       
                    <p>I’m done with my homework by 1.30pm so I decided to take a break for a while before class start.</p>
                    <p> So, I went to kitchen and saw my mom making Welcome-welcome <b> (read: Jemput-jemput)</b>. I took a few to my room since I’m hungry again.</p>
                    
                                                            <center><img src="jem.jpg" alt="Welcomewelcomee" width="250" height="250">  </center>
                    
                    <p> The class ended at 4.30pm because the lecturer insist to finish discussing all the answer and some of the student who have low connection kinda struggle in keeping up with the class but nevertheless, I’m done with today class.</p>
                    
                       <center><img src="burin.gif" alt="MAlaskuh" width="498" height="278">  </center>
                    
                    <P>I did my Asr prayer and lay down on my bed as I decided to read some Web novels.  Usually I read them on <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/" target=_blank> Wattpad </a> but since MCO I've discovered <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.webcomics.manga&hl=en" target=_blank> Web Comic </a> apps and I enjoyed reading the comics available there. But I'm still a loyal fans to <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/drama/lookism/list?title_no=1049&page=1" target=_blank> Lookism Webtoon </a> and still waiting for the weekly update. </P>
                    
                    <P>It’s around 6.30pm now and my mom was bored so she decided to bake breads. I just watched her.
                    </P>
                    
                   <center><img src="doh.gif" alt="Mmm dapp" width="208" height="314">  </center>
                        
                        <p>                     I don’t wanna disturb my mom work so I just help her took pictures of her bread making process since she wanna post it on her fb later.
                    </p>
                                       
                    <p>My mom gonna let the dough rest for about 1-2 hours before she continue to work on them and bake. </p>
                    
                    <p>Its maghrib time and we perform our maghrib prayer and wait for dinner time. Since my mom is working on her bread me and my siblings decided to clean up the living room a little bit. My little sister does the sweeping while me and my little brother fold the clothes.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> Around 8.30pm the bread is done, looks yummy. </p>
                    
                       <center><img src="ro.jpg" alt="Rotidahsiapp" width="239" height="320">  </center>
                    
                  
                    
                    <P>We ate the bread, doing taste test since it was my mom’s first time making bread. Seriously, yummy!!
                    </P>
                    <P>“That’s all for dinner” mom said.
                    </P>
                    <P>Nahh, my mom was kidding. <i>*half-kidding*</i> she prepared a simple dinner, Cangkok manis goreng and telur dadar goreng. but i had the cangkok manis only. 
                    </P>
                      <center>  <img src="sayo.jpg" alt="Hidanganharini" width="250" height="250"> </center>
                    
                    <P>We cleaned up after eating and my families watched some random tv show together.
                    </P>
                    
                    <P>I perform my Isya’ prayer and does my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n6iVh2G2XM" target=_blank> Night skincare routine </a>. I checked my timetable for tomorrow and it’s packed with 8-10 class, 10-1 class and 4-6 class.
                    </P>
                    
                    <P>Since the task will be assigned tomorrow so, I just decided to chill for tonight. 
                    </P>
                    
                    <p>I played games, texts some friends, video calling them and catch up with todays’ news <i> (read: gossip) </i> as I didn’t get the chance to do that earlier. </p>
                    <p> I cant remember what time i slept but I always wake up in the middle of the night at 3 or 4 am every day and then can’t continue sleep. </p>
                    
                    <p>And that’s it, a kinda productive day in my life during MCO. </p>
                        
                    <p> Now that I shared mine, how is a MCO day for you?</p>
