            <h2> A Day In My Life : MCO EDITION!</h2>
            
            <P>My alarm goes off at 6:00 according to the setting. I wasn't asleep. I was awake for the whole night scrolling through my phone. Yeah an unhealthy habit I've developed since the <b>Movement Control Order (MCO) </b> start. 
</P>
            <P>I just swiped right the alarm to turn it off and perform my subuh prayer
</P>
            <P>It's 6.15 am or so and I’m in my room again. Figuring out what to do for today while scrolling through random videos on TikTok
</P>
            <P>It's 8 am and I felt hungry. It's a habit of mine to shower before having breakfast so i took a quick shower and dress up in my daily clothes.
</P>
            <P>I head to the kitchen and search for something to cook for breakfast. My families are still asleep. They woke up around 9 to 10 am
</P>
            <P>I found some instant noodle and decided to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwPXrkuTSYo" target=_blank> Mee Goreng Basah </a> as I watched the YouTube tutorial video the other night.
</P>
            
                    <P>So I prepared the ingredients and finished cooking around 9 am. </P>
                      <center> <img src="mi.jpg" alt="Mee Goreng Basah" width="240" height="320"> </center>
                    

<P>I sat at the dining table and had my breakfast while watching a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/my/title/81177545" target=_blank> Netflix drama </a>
 I'm currently watching. </P>                    
<P>I usually took a long time to finish my meal and managed to finish at least an episode of drama so it's almost 10.30 am by that time and I did my dishes. 
                    </P>                    
                    <P>After that I head back to my bedroom and decided to read some Web novels. Usually I read them on <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/" target=_blank> Wattpad </a> but since MCO I've discovered <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.webcomics.manga&hl=en" target=_blank> Web Comic </a> apps and I enjoyed reading the comics available there. But I'm still a loyal fans to <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/drama/lookism/list?title_no=1049&page=1" target=_blank> Lookism Webtoon </a> and still waiting for the weekly update. </P>
                    
                    <P>It's almost noon and my families were pretty much awake by that time. I could hear some hustling from the kitchen.
                    </P>
                    
                    <P>So, I went to kitchen and saw my mom making Welcome-welcome (read:  Jemput-jemput) so I helped her out a little in the kitchen.</P>
                                        <center><img src="jem.jpg" alt="Welcomewelcomee" width="250" height="250">  </center>

                        
                        <p>She’s making stir fried vegetables for lunch and I helped her preparing the ingredients by washing the veggies and cut them.It was a simple lunch with rice, vegetable side dish and fried egg. FYI we doesn’t cook meat everyday so today was like vege day so we’re just gonna eat that for now.
                    </p>
                                        <center>  <img src="sayo.jpg" alt="Hidanganharini" width="250" height="250"> </center>

                    
                    <P>So, after lunch my friend who just woke up text me and we gossiped for a while. Most of our conversations consist of whining and ranting on “when will the MCO will end?”, “I miss hanging out with you.” and “let’s hangout after MCO ends”. It’s kinda like a pattern so I just face those kind of chats coming in everyday but from different people. 
                    </P>
                                                         <center><img src="burin.gif" alt="MAlaskuh" width="498" height="278">  </center>   

                    <P>Suddenly, its 3pm and I haven’t perform my Zuhur prayer yet so I perform my prayer before deciding what I’m gonna do after this.
                    </P>
                    <P>After I perform prayer I switched on my laptop and played video games. my phone felt kinda bored by now so I decided to play Sims 4 </P>
                    
                    <P>I play for about 3 to 4 hours and take a break to perform Asr prayer.
                    </P>
                    <P>It’s around 6.30pm now and my mom was bored so she decided to bake breads. I just <b>watched </b> her.
                    </P>
                     <center><img src="doh.gif" alt="MMM" width="208" height="314"> 
                     </center>
                     
                    <P>I don’t wanna disturb my mom work so I just help her took pictures of her bread making process since she wanna post it on her fb later. 
                    </P>
                    <P>My mom gonna let the dough rest for about 1-2 hours before she continue to work on them and bake.
                    </P>
                    <P>Its maghrib time and we perform our maghrib prayer and wait for dinner time.
                    </P>
                    <P>Since my  mom is working on her bread me and my siblings decided to clean up the living room a little bit. My little sister does the sweeping while me and my little brother fold the clothes.
                    </P>
                    <P>Around 8.30pm the bread is done, looks yummy.
                    </P>
                    
                   <center><img src="ro.jpg" alt="Rotidahsiapp" width="239" height="320">  </center> 
                    
                    <P>We ate the bread, doing taste test since it was my mom’s first time making bread. Seriously, yummy!!
                    </P>
                    <P>“That’s all for dinner” mom said.
                    </P>
                    <P>Yeap, my mom actually limit us from eating too much since we done nothing during the MCO so eating too much is a NO.
                    </P>
                    <P>We cleaned up after eating and my families watched some random tv show together.
                    </P>
                    <P>I perform my Isya’ prayer and does my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n6iVh2G2XM" target=_blank> Night skincare routine </a>. I’m getting sleepy so I lay down and play some drama on Netflix till my eyes felt heavy and I slept.
                    </P>
                    <P>I actually goes to bed early but I always wake up in the middle of the night at 1 or 2 am and can’t continue sleep. That’s pretty much like every day except that my daily activity weren’t the same every single day.
                    </P>
                    
                    
                    <p>And that’s it, a random day in my life during MCO. </p>
                        <p> Now that I shared mine, how is a random MCO day for you?</p>
